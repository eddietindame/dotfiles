# Zen Mode Configuration
#
# This file is read by ~/.config/aerospace/scripts/zen-mode.sh
# which is triggered by alt-z (configured in aerospace.toml).
#
# Zen mode adds large left/right margins on the target monitor and switches
# to accordion layout, creating a centered, distraction-free workspace.
# Other monitors are unaffected.

# Margin size as a percentage of the target monitor's screen width.
# Applied equally to both left and right outer gaps.
# e.g. 20 on a 3440px monitor = 688px margins per side
margin-percent = 20

# Swap the target monitor's wallpaper while zen mode is active.
# The original wallpaper is restored on toggle off.
# Values: true | false
dim-wallpaper = true

# Wallpaper to use while zen mode is active.
# Values:
#   #<hex>    - a hex colour (e.g. #1a1a2e), generates a solid colour wallpaper
#   <path>    - path to an image file (e.g. a dimmed version of your wallpaper)
# Defaults to #000000 (black) if not set.
dim-wallpaper-path = #1a1a2e
# dim-wallpaper-path = /System/Library/Desktop Pictures/Solar Gradients.madesktop

# Hide sketchybar on the target monitor while zen mode is active.
# The bar remains visible on other displays (e.g. laptop).
# Also adjusts outer.top gap to reclaim the bar's space.
# Values: true | false
hide-sketchybar = true

# Which monitor to apply zen margins to.
# Values:
#   external  - first connected monitor that isn't "Built-in Retina Display"
#   <name>    - a specific monitor name (run `aerospace list-monitors` to see names)
# If the monitor can't be found, falls back to the currently focused monitor.
monitor = external

# --- Single-display overrides ---
# When only one display is connected (e.g. just the MacBook), these settings
# override the defaults above. Omit or comment out a key to fall back to the
# main setting.

# Margin percentage when on a single display.
single-display-margin-percent = 15

# Whether to swap the wallpaper on a single display.
# Values: true | false
single-display-dim-wallpaper = true

# Wallpaper to use on a single display (same format as dim-wallpaper-path).
# Values: #<hex> | <path>
single-display-dim-wallpaper-path = #000000

# Whether to hide sketchybar on a single display.
# Values: true | false
single-display-hide-sketchybar = true
