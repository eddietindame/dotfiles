# Zen Mode Configuration
#
# This file is read by ~/.config/aerospace/scripts/zen-mode.sh
# which is triggered by alt-z (configured in aerospace.toml).
#
# Zen mode adds large left/right margins on the target monitor and switches
# to accordion layout, creating a centered, distraction-free workspace.
# Other monitors are unaffected.

# Margin size as a percentage of the target monitor's screen width.
# Applied equally to both left and right outer gaps.
# e.g. 20 on a 3440px monitor = 688px margins per side
margin-percent = 20

# Which monitor to apply zen margins to.
# Values:
#   external  - first connected monitor that isn't "Built-in Retina Display"
#   <name>    - a specific monitor name (run `aerospace list-monitors` to see names)
# If the monitor can't be found, falls back to the currently focused monitor.
monitor = external
